## v1.19.0 Feb 01 2024
- Enable equation block preconditioning for sparse unknown storage

## v1.18.0 Feb 01 2024
- Re-shoring of OrdinaryDiffEq interface, no need of VoronoiFVMDiffEq.jl anymore
  It appeared that it is sufficient to depend on SciMLBase for this, and
  all tests can be done with OrdinaryDiffEq.jl

## v1.17.1 Jan 30, 2024
- Bugfix for boundary node factors
- Bugfix with types for RecursiveArrayTools

## v1.16.0 Dec 15, 2023

## v1.15.0 Dec 1, 2023
- Adjusted time/embedding stepping scheme, added `num_final_steps` to  [`VoronoiFVM.SolverControl`](@ref). This may lead to
  sligthly different results when solving time dependent problems. Some unit test values have been adapted. Before,
  accidentally, very small time steps at the end of an evolution were possible.
  
## v1.14.0 Nov 27, 2023
- Add `Δu_max_factor` and `Δt_decrease` to [`VoronoiFVM.SolverControl`](@ref). 
  Before (with values 2.0 and 0.5, respectively) the were fixed. New `Δu_max_factor=1.2` default.
- Add history to [`VoronoiFVM.TransientSolution`](@ref), prepare deprecation of `system.history`
- Add [`plothistory`](@ref) method

- Use AbstractTransientSolution in gridvisualize stuff

## v1.9.0 June 27, 2023
- With `control.handle_exceptions=true`, in case of a failing step,
  time stepping and embeding now returns the solution calculated so far instead of
  throwing an error

## v1.8.0 June 20, 2023
- LinearSolve 2.x

## v1.7.0 May 17, 2023
- Discrete Sobolev norms

## v1.6.0 May 12, 2023
- Rework linear solver strategies - prevent combinatorial explosion. 
  E.g. `gmres_iluzero` is now `GMRESIteration(ILUZeroPreconditioner())` etc.

## v1.5.0 May 9, 2023
- Introduced solver strategies like `gmres_iluzero()`, `direct_umfpack()` etc.
  See documentation of the module `VoronoiFVM.SolverStrategies`. More to come.
- edgewise assembly - faster in particular for 3D
- Plan: edgewise assembly seems to be non-breaking, 
  if this is confirmed, will be made default in 1.6 or (if it appears to be breaking
  for some) in 2.0.

## v1.4.0 May 3, 2023
- equation-block preconditioning support with the help of ExtendableSparse.jl

## v1.0.0 Feb 22, 2023
- full LinearSolve compatibility

## v0.19.0 Jan 31, 2023
This is a breaking release. Implementations using default solver settings should continue to work without modifications, 
albeit possibly showing  deprecation and  allocation warnings. 
Really breaking is control of iterative linear solvers and allocation checks.

### Breaking
- Make `solve` a method of `CommonSolve.solve` (and re-export it). 
- Rely on `LinearSolve.jl` for linear system solution including control of iterative solvers.
- New verbosity handling. `verbose` can now be a Bool or a String of flag characters, allowing for control of different output categories. I would love to do this via  logging, but there is still a [long way to go](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/33418) IMHO 
- Allocation check is active by default with warnings instead of throwing an error. These warnings can be muted by passing a `verbose` string without 'a'. This is now the only control in this respect. All `check_allocs` methods/kwargs, control via environment variables have been removed.
- Deprecation warnings can be switched off by passing a `verbose` string without 'd'.
- Improve iteration logging etc., allow for logging of linear iterations ('l' flag character)


### Deprecations
- Deprecated all `VoronoiFVM.solve` methods with signatures others than `solve(system; kwargs...)` which renders them incompatible to the philosophy of `CommonSolve. Updated examples accordingly.
- Deprecated the following entries of SolverControl/solve kwargs: 
   `:tol_absolute` => `:abstol`,
    `:tol_relative` => `:reltol`,
    `:damp` => `:damp_initial`,
    `:damp_grow` => `:damp_growth`
    `:max_iterations` => `e:maxiters`
    `:tol_linear` => `:reltol_linear`
    `:max_lureuse` =>
- `NewtonControl`


## v0.18.8 - 0.18.10  Dec 11, 2022 - Jan 5, 2023
- Internal restructuring: remove `@create_physics_wrappers` macro, reduce boilerplate in assembly, wrap repeating pattenrns
  into functions.  The price in the moment is a bit of a slowdown of assembly.
- Fix parameter dependency handling (now we can get parameter derivative without solving in dual numbers; see
  the runh() example in Example430. However in the moment the advantatge is not very clear, so this  is
  on hold...

Introduce the notion of quantities which can be continuous or discontinuous at interfaces.

- Quantity handling is implemented on top of species handling
- Unknowns u and rhs y now passed to callbacks as wrapper types, 
  and can be indexed by quantity or by species numbers. 
  Moreover, this will allow to abstract parameters, gradients etc. in future versions.

## v0.12.0, July 2 2021
-  By default, the `u` parameter in flux callbacks is now a  `nspec x 2` array
- `unknowns(edge,u)`, `viewK, viewL` are obsolete, they still work for backward compatibility
- `physics.num_species` is now meaningless, num_species is automatically detected.
- `SparseSystem` and `DenseSystem` are now type aliases of a parametrized type instead of two
   independent subtypes of `System`

## v0.10.0 Jan 9 2021
- Moving visualization to the package [GridVisualize.jl](https://github.com/j-fu/GridVisualize.jl), emerging from 
  the visualization methods in ExtendableGrids


## v0.9.0 Dec 21 2020
- Add the possibility to interface with [DifferentialEquations.jl](https://diffeq.sciml.ai/stable/)
- __Breaking__: The API change to passing the unknowns to the
  an edge callback as a matrix turned out to be a dead end in the
  strategic sense. In order to extend functionality, we need to be able
  to pass more data to  which we can apply differetiation. Particular plans
  involve bifurcation parameters and reconstructed gradients.
  So we return to the viewK/viewL pattern we had before. However, 
  these are now aliases:
  - `viewK(edge,u)=unknowns(edge,u,1)`
  - `viewL(edge,u)=unknowns(edge,u,2)`
  In order to ease refactoring in the case where models have been
  implemented with Matrix access to the unknowns, `unknowns(edge,u)`
  returns a matrix of the edge unknowns.   
  For refactoring, just rewrite e.g.
```julia
    function flux(y,u,edge)
        for ispec=1:nspec
            y[ispec]=u[ispec,1]-u[ispec,2]
        end
    end
```
  to
```julia
    function flux(y,u0,edge)
        u=unknowns(edge,u0)
        for ispec=1:nspec
            y[ispec]=u[ispec,1]-u[ispec,2]
        end
    end
```

- Update ExtendableGrids + ExtendableSparse

## v0.8.3 June 25 2020
- Replace splatting by dispatch on availability of data record

## v0.8.2 May 15 2020

- Introduced update_grid! for triggering re-calculation
  if coordinates have changed

## v0.8.1 May 2 2020
- Introduce evolve! : time solver with automatic timestep control

## v0.8 Apr 28, 2020
- Replaced VoronoiFVM grid module by  [ExtendableGrids.jl](https://github.com/j-fu/ExtendableGrids.jl)
- Moved grid generation, modification, plotting  over to ExtendableGrids
- Necessary changes in codes using VoronoiFVM:
  - Replace `grid.coord` by `coord` obtained via `coord=coordinates(grid)` or  `coord=grid[Coordinates]` after importing ExtendableGrids
  - Replace `VoronoiFVM.plot` by `ExtendableGrids.plot`.
  - In the plot method, Plotter is now a keyword argument
  - `VoronoiFVM.Grid()` now returns a ExtendableGrids.ExtendableGrid, 
    in fact it is just an alias to [ExtendableGrids.simplexgrid](https://j-fu.github.io/ExtendableGrids.jl/stable/search/?q=simplexgrid)
  - For using any methods on grids like cellmask! one needs to use `ExtendableGrids`
  - Subgrids now are of the same type `ExtendableGrids`,  views are currently defined for vectors only.
  
## v0.7 Feb 28 2020
- API modification:
  - __Breaking__:
    - `data` parameter passed to physics callbacks only if `Physics` object is created with `data` parameter.

      This makes the API more consistent in the case that parameters are just taken from the closure (the scope where the physics functions are defined)
      and no data `object` has been created.
    - Replace `node.coord[i]` by  `node[i]`.
    - Replace `edge.coordK[i]` by  `edge[i,1]`.
    - Replace `edge.coordL[i]` by  `edge[i,2]`.

      This now directly accesses the coordinate field of the grid and avoids copying of the coordinates
  - Backward compatible:  
    - No need for `viewK and viewL` in edge callbacks (they also make trouble with allocations...)
        - Replace `uk[i]` by `u[i,1]`
        - Replace `ul[i]` by `u[i,2]`
     - Replace `VoronoiFVM.DenseSystem(...)`  by `VoronoiFVM.System(..., unknown_storage=:dense)`
     - Replace `VoronoiFVM.SparseSystem(...)` by `VoronoiFVM.System(..., unknown_storage=:sparse)`

- No allocations anymore in assembly loop:
  - Replaced `ElasticArray` in `Grid` by normal one - this was the largest regression
  - Return `nothing` from mutating methods to avoid some allocations 
  - Indexing in `formfactors.jl` with `Int`
